This repository contains notebooks with illustrative examples of dynamical systems possessing invariant manifolds that are locally unstable at every point, but are globally stable. These examples are split into two files, 1) The case of non-compact manifolds and 2) The case of limit cycles.

These results are drawn from the following references:
